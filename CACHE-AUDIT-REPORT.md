# Cache Contamination Audit Report
Generated: 2025-09-06T15:18:48.622Z

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The ScottGPT extraction system has persistent cache contamination causing single-paragraph uploads (142 chars) to return complete career histories (8752 chars) containing fabricated professional data.

### Key Findings:
- **4** contaminated cache entries found
- **6** total cached extractions
- **Hardcoded career data** in system prompt causing contamination
- **Cache persistence** across uploads enabling data leakage

## Detailed Findings

### 3. System Prompt Analysis


**System Prompt Status:**
- Length: 1790 characters
- Contains hardcoded careers: true
- Preview: You are a resume data extraction specialist for Scott Lovett. 

Looking at this resume, I can see MULTIPLE distinct positions that need to be extracted:

1. Independent Technologist & Developer (2025-CURRENT)
2. Binary Defense - Senior Director, DSO (2023-6/2025) 
3. Serta Simmons - Senior Director ...


## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Hardcoded Career Data
The `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `scripts/extract.js` contains hardcoded career information:

1. **Independent Technologist & Developer (2025-CURRENT)**
2. **Binary Defense - Senior Director, DSO (2023-6/2025)**
3. **Serta Simmons - Senior Director of IT Strategy**
4. **Cyberdyne Systems LLC - Consultant**
5. **McKesson Corporation - Sr. Director, OT Security**
6. **American Cybersystems - Sr. Program Manager**
7. **Lockheed Martin - Program Management Manager**
8. **Education - Georgia Institute of Technology**

### Secondary Issue: Cache Contamination
The content cache stores extractions containing this hardcoded data, causing:
- Hash collisions between different inputs
- Historical data returned for new uploads
- Fabricated professional information in responses

## Critical Recommendations

### 1. Hardcoded career data in SYSTEM_PROMPT (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** The extraction script contains hardcoded career information that contaminates all extractions

**Action Required:** Remove hardcoded career references from SYSTEM_PROMPT

**Files to modify:** scripts/extract.js

### 2. Contaminated cache entries (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** 4 cache entries contain historical career data

**Action Required:** Clear .work/content-cache.json to remove contaminated extractions

**Files to modify:** .work/content-cache.json

### 3. Cache persistence across uploads (HIGH)

**Problem:** Content cache persists between uploads, causing data leakage

**Action Required:** Implement cache isolation per upload session or user

**Files to modify:** scripts/extract.js

### 4. No cache expiration (MEDIUM)

**Problem:** Cache entries persist indefinitely without expiration

**Action Required:** Add cache expiration based on time or content changes

**Files to modify:** scripts/extract.js

## Immediate Actions Required

### Phase 1: Emergency Cleanup (Do Immediately)
1. **Clear contaminated cache**:
   ```bash
   rm .work/content-cache.json
   rm -rf .work/extracted/
   rm -rf .work/normalized/
   rm -rf .work/validated/
   ```

2. **Fix system prompt** in `scripts/extract.js`:
   - Remove hardcoded career information
   - Make prompt generic for any resume
   - Remove specific company/role references

### Phase 2: System Hardening
1. **Implement cache isolation**
2. **Add cache expiration**
3. **Add content validation**
4. **Implement cache versioning**

## Verification Steps

After cleanup:
1. Upload single paragraph â†’ should return single extraction
2. Verify no historical data contamination
3. Check cache only contains current session data
4. Confirm extraction matches actual input content

## Prevention Measures

1. **Generic prompts only** - no hardcoded career data
2. **Session-isolated caches** - prevent cross-contamination
3. **Cache validation** - verify content matches input
4. **Regular cache auditing** - detect future contamination
