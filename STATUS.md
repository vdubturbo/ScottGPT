# ScottGPT System Status

Last Updated: August 16, 2025

## Current System Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL

The RAG pipeline is fully functional with all major issues resolved.

## Recent Fixes Implemented

### 1. RAG Pipeline Root Cause Fixes (August 2025)

#### Database Query Order Problem ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Database returned chunks in random order, not by similarity
- **Solution**: Increased retrieval limit from 200 to 1000 chunks, calculate similarity for all chunks before filtering
- **Impact**: High-similarity content (like OLDP) now properly retrieved

#### Filter-First Architecture Flaw ✅ FIXED  
- **Issue**: Filters applied before similarity calculation, excluding relevant content
- **Solution**: Calculate similarity first, apply filters as soft preferences with small boost (0.02 per match)
- **Impact**: High-relevance content prioritized regardless of filter matches

#### Text Search Fallback Corruption ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Text search triggered too aggressively, assigned fake high similarity scores (0.6-0.8)
- **Solution**: Only trigger when NO semantic results, reduce text match confidence to 0.3
- **Impact**: Semantic matches properly prioritized, no more result corruption

#### Similarity Thresholds ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Thresholds too high (0.35-0.45), missing relevant content
- **Solution**: Lowered to 0.25-0.35 for better recall
- **Impact**: More relevant content retrieved while maintaining quality

## Database Statistics

- **Total Sources**: 71 (as of Aug 16, 2025)
- **Total Chunks**: 533 with embeddings
- **Embedding Coverage**: 99.8%
- **Recent Additions**: 
  - First-Line Operations Manager (Lockheed Martin)
  - Program Management Manager (Lockheed Martin)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Indexer Timeout**: Debug timeout set to 2 minutes causes false "failure" message even when processing completes
2. **Source Directory**: Currently empty as content lives in `archives/` directory
3. **Text Search Syntax**: Some complex OR queries may have syntax issues (non-critical, fallback works)

### Not Issues (Working as Designed)
1. **Operations Manager as OLDP**: The Operations Manager role (2004-2007) was correctly part of the OLDP program (2001-2005)
2. **Archives Directory**: Intentionally excluded from git via .gitignore

## Ingestion Pipeline Status

### Last Run: August 16, 2025
- **Input**: 1755382441978-IntSubs.docx
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully processed
- **Output**: 2 job entries extracted and embedded
- **Performance**: ~2 minutes total processing time

### Pipeline Components
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Document Normalization | ✅ Working | Converts DOCX/PDF to Markdown |
| OpenAI Extraction | ✅ Working | Extracts structured data from documents |
| Content Validation | ✅ Working | Validates and tags content |
| Embedding Generation | ✅ Working | Cohere API generates 1024-dim embeddings |
| Database Storage | ✅ Working | Supabase stores with pgvector |
| Archive Process | ✅ Working | Moves processed files to archives/ |

## API Keys & Services

| Service | Status | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| OpenAI GPT-4 | ✅ Active | Document extraction & chat responses |
| Cohere (embed-english-v3.0) | ✅ Active | Embedding generation |
| Supabase | ✅ Active | Vector database & storage |

## To-Do List

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix indexer timeout issue (increase from 2 minutes or make configurable)
- [ ] Add better error handling for pipeline failures
- [ ] Implement retry logic for API failures

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Add admin UI for content management
- [ ] Implement conversation history persistence
- [ ] Add export functionality for chat sessions
- [ ] Create backup/restore functionality for database

### Low Priority
- [ ] Optimize embedding dimensions (currently 1024)
- [ ] Add support for more file formats
- [ ] Implement caching layer for frequent queries
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard

## Testing Checklist

### RAG Pipeline Tests
- [x] OLDP query returns Lockheed Martin experience ✅
- [x] IoT query returns Coca-Cola Freestyle work ✅
- [x] No hallucination or time period mixing ✅
- [x] Proper source attribution ✅
- [x] New content immediately searchable ✅

### Sample Test Queries
```bash
# Test OLDP content
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about Scott's OLDP experience at Lockheed Martin"}'

# Test IoT content  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What was Scott's IoT work at Coca-Cola?"}'

# Test recent content
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about Scott's First Line Operations Manager role"}'
```
