# Complete Vector Storage Fix - Run this to implement the real solution
echo "🚀 Starting complete vector storage fix..."

echo ""
echo "📋 STEP 1: Run the SQL migrations in Supabase SQL Editor"
echo "======================================================="
echo ""
echo "Copy and paste EACH of these files into Supabase SQL Editor in ORDER:"
echo ""
echo "1. debug-column-types.sql (optional - check your schema)"
echo ""
echo "2. migrations/002_fix_vector_storage.sql"
echo "   - Creates proper vector insertion function"
echo "   - Converts existing JSON strings to real vectors"
echo "   - Verifies the conversion worked"
echo ""
echo "3. migrations/004_fix_function_types.sql" 
echo "   - Creates search function with correct data types"
echo "   - Tests the function"
echo ""
echo "4. migrations/005_fix_insert_types.sql"
echo "   - Fixes the insert function data types"
echo ""
echo "📝 After running migrations 2, 4, and 5, you should see:"
echo "   ✅ 'Vector conversion complete! Converted X records'"
echo "   ✅ 'Fixed Function Test' should return > 0 results"
echo ""

echo "🧪 STEP 2: Test the fix"
echo "======================="
echo ""
echo "After running the SQL migrations, test with:"
echo "   node test-after-migration-fix.js"
echo ""
echo "Expected results:"
echo "   ✅ JavaScript search: ~5 results in ~500ms"
echo "   ✅ pgvector search: ~5 results in ~200ms"
echo "   🚀 Performance improvement: 2-3x faster"
echo ""

echo "🔄 STEP 3: Do you need to reprocess files?"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""
echo "NO! You do NOT need to reprocess files because:"
echo ""
echo "✅ The migration script fixes ALL existing data automatically"
echo "✅ New files will use the proper RPC function going forward"
echo "✅ All embeddings are already in the database as JSON strings"
echo "✅ The migration converts them to proper PostgreSQL vectors"
echo ""
echo "The fix is purely about STORAGE FORMAT, not the embedding data itself."
echo ""

echo "🎯 SUMMARY"
echo "=========="
echo ""
echo "This fix addresses the ROOT CAUSE:"
echo "❌ Before: Supabase stored JS arrays as JSON strings"
echo "✅ After: PostgreSQL functions handle proper vector conversion"
echo ""
echo "Architecture changes:"
echo "• Uses RPC functions for vector storage and search"
echo "• Converts existing data from JSON strings to vectors"
echo "• Maintains backward compatibility with legacy storage"
echo ""
echo "No file reprocessing needed - just run the migrations!"
echo ""
echo "🔥 Let's get this pgvector performance boost!"
echo ""
echo "🚨 NOTE: If you got a data type error, that's why I added migrations 4 & 5"
echo "   - Migration 4 fixes the search function with correct types"
echo "   - Migration 5 fixes the insert function with correct types"
echo "   - Run debug-column-types.sql first if you want to see your actual schema"
