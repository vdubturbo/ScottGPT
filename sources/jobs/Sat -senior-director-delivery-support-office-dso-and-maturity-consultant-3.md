# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with previous leadership struggling to maintain control over risk, budget, and schedule. My primary responsibility was to strengthen product execution and improve time-to-value while aligning delivery with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members, including project managers, product owners, and technical leads, all focused on delivering high-quality cybersecurity solutions to clients in regulated industries.

## Highlights
- **Portfolio Revitalization:** Collaborated with executive leadership to assess product development inefficiencies, resulting in a prioritized roadmap that scaled cybersecurity capabilities and improved customer adoption.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Implemented a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that enhanced product visibility and predictability through improved scope definition and agile delivery frameworks.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to focus on customer feedback and value delivery, rather than mere status updates.

## Technical Details
- Utilized Agile methodologies to facilitate iterative releases, with KPIs tied to user impact and ROI.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping to enhance budget management.
- Established PMR cycles and risk/change governance aligned to product milestones.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Improved Product Cost Management:** Achieved a 90% YoY improvement in budget variance, reducing it to within 3% through effective financial oversight.
- **Cyber Risk Culture:** Developed and operationalized a scalable Risk Management framework, enabling earlier detection and mitigation of cyber risks.
- **Agile Transformation:** Successfully launched the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, establishing a repeatable product release process.
- **Accelerated Delivery:** Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months, enhancing responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams around value streams instead of projects.
