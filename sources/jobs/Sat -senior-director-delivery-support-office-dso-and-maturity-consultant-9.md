# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with risk, budget, and schedule control due to prior leadership struggles. My focus was on strengthening product execution, improving time-to-value, and aligning delivery with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team comprised cross-functional members from product management, engineering, and customer success, working collaboratively to enhance the overall delivery framework.

## Highlights
- **Portfolio Revitalization:** Partnered with executive leadership to assess product development and process inefficiencies, producing a prioritized roadmap for scaling cybersecurity capabilities and improving customer adoption.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Established a 30/60/90-day transformation plan focused on improving product visibility and predictability through enhanced scope definition and requirements traceability tied to customer use cases.
- **Agile Transformation:** Launched and scaled the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, proving the model and establishing a repeatable product release process.

## Technical Details
- Implemented Agile delivery frameworks for iterative releases, with KPIs tied to user impact and ROI.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping and delivery cadence to improve budget management.
- Developed a customer-centric operating rhythm that re-engineered internal communications and stakeholder engagement to focus on customer feedback and value delivery.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Improved Product Cost Management:** Reduced budget variance to within 3%, a 90% YoY improvement, by integrating finance controls with product roadmapping and delivery cadence.
- **Cyber Risk Culture:** Authored and operationalized a scalable Risk Management framework embedded in product lifecycle reviews, enabling earlier detection and mitigation of cyber risks in the portfolio.
- **Accelerated Delivery:** Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months and improved responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams around value streams instead of projects, significantly enhancing the organization's agility and market responsiveness.
