# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with prior leadership struggling with risk, budget, and schedule control. My responsibilities included strengthening product execution, improving time-to-value, and aligning delivery with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members focused on enhancing product visibility and predictability, while I reported directly to the executive leadership team.

## Highlights
- **Portfolio Revitalization:** Collaborated with executive leadership to assess product development inefficiencies, resulting in a prioritized roadmap that scaled cybersecurity capabilities and improved customer adoption.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Implemented a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that enhanced scope definition and requirements traceability, leading to improved product visibility and predictability.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to focus on customer feedback and value delivery, enhancing stakeholder engagement.

## Technical Details
- Utilized Agile methodologies to establish iterative release cycles, with KPIs tied to user impact and ROI.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping to improve budget management.
- Developed a scalable Risk Management framework embedded in product lifecycle reviews, enabling earlier detection of cyber risks.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Improved Product Cost Management:** Achieved a reduction in budget variance to within 3%, marking a 90% improvement year-over-year.
- **Cyber Risk Culture:** Authored and operationalized a Risk Management framework that enhanced the organization's ability to detect and mitigate cyber risks.
- **Agile Transformation:** Successfully launched and scaled the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, establishing a repeatable product release process.
- **Accelerated Delivery:** Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months and improved responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams around value streams instead of projects. 

This role not only allowed me to leverage my extensive experience in program management and cybersecurity but also positioned Binary Defense for future growth and success in a rapidly evolving industry.
