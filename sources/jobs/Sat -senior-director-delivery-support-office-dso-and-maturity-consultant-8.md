# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with prior leadership struggling to maintain risk, budget, and schedule control. My primary focus was on revitalizing the PMO to improve product execution and align delivery with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members, including project managers, product owners, and technical leads, working collaboratively to enhance the overall delivery framework.

## Highlights
- **Delivery Restructuring:** Partnered with executive leadership to assess project management inefficiencies, resulting in a prioritized roadmap that improved customer adoption and capability delivery.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Established a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that enhanced project execution predictability through improved scope definition and Agile delivery frameworks.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to focus on customer feedback and value delivery, enhancing stakeholder engagement.

## Technical Details
- Implemented Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban, to facilitate iterative releases and improve responsiveness to market needs.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping to enhance budget management and reduce variance.
- Developed a scalable Risk Management framework that was embedded in product lifecycle reviews, allowing for earlier detection and mitigation of cyber risks.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Improved Product Cost Management:** Achieved a 90% YoY improvement in budget variance, reducing it to within 3% through effective financial oversight.
- **Agile Transformation:** Successfully launched and scaled the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, establishing a repeatable product release process.
- **Accelerated Delivery:** Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months by restructuring teams around value streams, significantly improving responsiveness to market demands.

In summary, my leadership at Binary Defense has not only revitalized the PMO but also positioned the organization for sustainable growth in a highly competitive cybersecurity landscape.
