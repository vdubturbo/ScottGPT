# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with prior leadership struggling to manage risk, budget, and schedule control. My primary focus was on strengthening product execution, improving time-to-value, and aligning delivery with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members, and I reported directly to the executive leadership team, ensuring that our initiatives were closely aligned with the company's overall strategy.

## Highlights
- **Portfolio Revitalization:** Collaborated with executive leadership to assess product development inefficiencies, resulting in a prioritized roadmap that enhanced cybersecurity capabilities and improved customer adoption.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Implemented a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that improved product visibility and predictability through enhanced scope definition and Agile delivery frameworks.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to focus on customer feedback and value delivery, which fostered a more responsive and adaptive organizational culture.

## Technical Details
- Utilized Agile methodologies to implement iterative release cycles, which were tied to key performance indicators (KPIs) focused on user impact and return on investment (ROI).
- Integrated financial oversight with product roadmapping, ensuring that budget management was closely monitored and aligned with project milestones.
- Established a risk management framework that was embedded in product lifecycle reviews, enabling earlier detection and mitigation of cyber risks.

## Key Accomplishments
- Achieved a 90% year-over-year improvement in budget variance, reducing it to within 3% through effective financial controls.
- Successfully launched the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, establishing a repeatable product release process.
- Cut product planning cycle time by three months, significantly improving responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams around value streams rather than projects. 

This role not only allowed me to leverage my extensive experience in program management and cybersecurity but also positioned Binary Defense for future growth and success in a rapidly evolving market.
