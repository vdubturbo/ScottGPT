- **Change Management:** Developed and instituted a Change Management process and Control Board, enhancing accountability and efficiency in project delivery.
- **Agile Framework Implementation:** Designed a basic Agile framework that allowed for iterative project execution, leading to successful ongoing operations of the Liberty "Strike Team."
- **Strategic Guidance:** Positioned as a trusted advisor to key stakeholders, facilitating improved communication and alignment between Liberty and Binary Defense teams.

## Technical Details
