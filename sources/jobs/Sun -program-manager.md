# Context
In January 2024, I joined Binary Defense as a Program Manager to support the Liberty Cyber Program, which was struggling with significant budget management and project scope issues. The previous year had seen the program end with a multi-million dollar budget deviation, and there was a lack of formal processes for risk management and change control. My role involved leading a team of cybersecurity professionals and collaborating with various stakeholders to enhance the program's overall effectiveness. The Liberty Cyber Program operates within a highly regulated environment, necessitating strict adherence to compliance and risk management standards.
