# Context
In my role as Senior Director of Delivery Support Office & Business Maturity Consultant at Binary Defense, I was recruited to address and revitalize a struggling $30M portfolio of cybersecurity projects. The organization specializes in providing advanced cybersecurity solutions, and my primary focus was to enhance project delivery capabilities that had been hampered by previous leadership challenges. The team consisted of cross-functional members from various departments, and I reported directly to the executive leadership team. The key challenges included managing budgets, schedules, and risks effectively while ensuring alignment between technical and business teams.

## Highlights
- **Budget Management:** Drastically improved financial management processes, allowing the delivery team to manage the budget to within 3% of baseline, a significant improvement compared to the previous year.
- **Project Planning Efficiency:** Reduced project planning time by 3 months, reallocating that time to execution and delivery, which significantly enhanced overall project timelines.
- **Risk Management Framework:** Authored and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Process and established a Risk Review Board, fostering a culture of risk awareness and management.
- **Change Management:** Developed a formal Change Management process and instituted a Change Control Board that meets weekly to assess project changes, driving accountability and control.

## Technical Details
- **Tools Used:** Implemented Azure DevOps for iterative project management, which set the groundwork for a more mature Agile framework in 2025.
- **Methodologies:** Employed Agile methodologies, focusing on continuous improvement and process maturity to enhance project execution.
- **Process Optimization:** Instituted a 30/60/90-day plan that included raising project management standards, enhancing schedule and budget tracking, and developing comprehensive Risk and Change Management frameworks.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Quantified Improvements:** Achieved a 3-month reduction in project planning time, which allowed for more focus on execution and delivery.
- **Enhanced Reporting:** Standardized project reporting with clear status thresholds (R/Y/G) and program roll-ups, significantly improving communication with senior leadership.
- **Cultural Shift:** Fostered a disciplined and proactive project management culture that emphasized accountability and transparency across the organization.

Through these initiatives, I was able to not only stabilize the project portfolio but also lay the foundation for future growth and maturity in project management practices within Binary Defense.
