# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with prior leadership struggling to maintain control over risk, budget, and schedule. My primary responsibility was to strengthen product execution through PMO revitalization, ensuring alignment with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members, including project managers, product owners, and technical leads, all focused on delivering high-quality cybersecurity solutions.

## Highlights
- **Delivery Restructuring:** Collaborated with executive leadership to assess and improve project management processes, resulting in a prioritized roadmap that enhanced capability delivery and customer adoption.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Implemented a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that improved project execution predictability through enhanced scope definition, Agile delivery frameworks, and risk/change governance aligned to product milestones.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to emphasize customer feedback and value delivery, leading to improved stakeholder engagement and satisfaction.

## Technical Details
- Utilized Agile methodologies to facilitate iterative releases and improve project predictability.
- Established KPIs tied to user impact and ROI, ensuring that project outcomes aligned with customer needs.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping to enhance budget management and reduce variance.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Improved Product Cost Management:** Achieved a budget variance reduction to within 3%, marking a 90% year-over-year improvement by integrating financial oversight into the delivery process.
- **Cyber Risk Culture:** Developed and operationalized a scalable Risk Management framework that enabled earlier detection and mitigation of cyber risks within the product lifecycle.
- **Agile Transformation:** Successfully launched and scaled the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, establishing a repeatable product release process.
- **Accelerated Delivery:** Reduced product planning cycle time by 3 months, enhancing responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams around value streams rather than traditional project-based approaches.
