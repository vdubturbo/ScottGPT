# Context
In my role as the Senior Director of Delivery Support Office and Business Maturity Consultant at Binary Defense, I was brought on board to address significant challenges within a $30M portfolio of cybersecurity projects. The organization specializes in providing advanced cybersecurity solutions, and my primary objective was to improve project execution and delivery capabilities that had faltered under previous leadership. The team consisted of cross-functional experts in cybersecurity, project management, and compliance, and I reported directly to the executive leadership team. The key challenges included ineffective budget management, lack of structured project oversight, and insufficient risk management processes.

- **Risk and Change Management**: Authored and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management process and a Change Control Board, fostering a culture of accountability and proactive risk management.
- **Enhanced Communication**: Improved internal communications and transparency, which significantly enhanced engagement with senior leadership.

## Technical Details
- **Methodologies**: Employed Agile methodologies, specifically introducing a basic Agile framework utilizing Azure DevOps for iterative project management.
- **Tools**: Utilized Azure DevOps for project tracking and management, alongside traditional project management tools like MS Project and JIRA for planning and reporting.
- **Process Improvements**: Established rigorous monthly Project Management Review (PMR) cycles and developed comprehensive Risk and Change Management frameworks to enhance project oversight.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Quantified Improvements**: Achieved a 3-month reduction in project planning time, which directly contributed to improved project delivery timelines and resource allocation.
- **Cultural Shift**: Fostered a disciplined project management culture that emphasized proactive risk management and accountability, leading to enhanced team performance.
