# Context
In my role as Senior Director of Delivery Support Office & Business Maturity Consultant at Binary Defense, I was brought on board to address significant challenges in managing a $30M portfolio of cybersecurity projects. The organization specializes in providing cybersecurity solutions and services, and my primary focus was to improve delivery capabilities and project execution, which had been hindered by previous leadership issues. The team consisted of cross-functional members from various departments, and I reported directly to the executive leadership team. The key challenges included budget overruns, schedule delays, and ineffective risk management practices.

## Highlights
- **Budget Management**: Reimagined financial management processes, achieving a budget adherence of within 3% of baseline, a significant improvement from previous years.
- **Project Planning Efficiency**: Reduced project planning time by 3 months, allowing for a greater focus on execution and delivery.
- **Risk Management Framework**: Authored and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management process and tool, fostering a culture of risk awareness.
- **Change Management**: Established a Change Control Board that meets weekly to assess project changes, enhancing accountability and control.

## Technical Details
- **Methodologies**: Implemented Agile methodologies, specifically a basic Agile framework, to improve project management capabilities.
- **Tools**: Utilized Azure DevOps for iterative project management, setting the groundwork for a more mature framework in the upcoming year.
- **Process Improvements**: Instituted a 30/60/90-day plan focusing on quick wins and long-term strategies, including rigorous monthly Project Management Review (PMR) cycles.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Enhanced Communication**: Improved transparency and engagement through streamlined internal communications, which significantly enhanced risk management and communication with senior leadership.
- **Standardized Reporting**: Developed a reliable master schedule with robust interdependency mapping and standardized project reporting with clear status thresholds.
- **Cultural Shift**: Fostered a disciplined, proactive project management culture that emphasized accountability and continuous improvement.

Through these initiatives, I successfully transformed the project delivery landscape at Binary Defense, ensuring that the organization could effectively manage its cybersecurity projects and meet its strategic objectives.
