# Context
In January 2024, I joined Binary Defense as the Cyber Program Manager for Liberty Utilities, a government entity focused on enhancing cybersecurity capabilities. The Liberty Cyber Program faced significant challenges, including a multi-million dollar budget gap from the previous year, lack of formal risk management processes, and inconsistent project management practices. My role involved leading a team of cybersecurity professionals and collaborating with various stakeholders to implement structured processes that would improve overall program performance.

## Highlights
- **Budget Monitoring & Performance:** Implemented new financial management processes that reduced budget variance to within 3% of forecast, a drastic improvement from the previous year's untracked spending.
- **Risk Management:** Developed and published a comprehensive Risk Management Process, fostering a culture of risk awareness and establishing a formal Risk Review Board for ongoing risk assessment.
- **Change Management:** Authored and implemented a Change Management process, creating a Change Control Board to monitor project changes, enhancing accountability and efficiency.
- **Agile Framework Implementation:** Designed a basic Agile framework that allowed for iterative project management, leading to successful project execution by the Liberty "Strike Team."
- **Strategic Guidance:** Acted as a trusted advisor to senior leadership, resolving delivery issues and improving interdepartmental communication and collaboration.

## Technical Details
- Utilized project management tools and methodologies to establish a structured approach to budget monitoring, risk management, and change control.
- Implemented Agile practices to enhance project delivery and responsiveness to stakeholder needs.
- Developed a maturity roadmap for the Cyber Program, outlining strategic improvements and dependencies for ongoing development.

## Key Accomplishments
- Delivered a comprehensive improvement plan that resulted in a year-over-year increase in delivery excellence for the Liberty Cyber Program.
