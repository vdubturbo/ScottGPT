# Context
In his role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, Scott Lovett was brought on board to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with prior leadership struggling to maintain control over risk, budget, and schedule. Scott's primary objective was to strengthen product execution through PMO revitalization and improve time-to-value by aligning delivery with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members including project managers, product owners, and technical leads, all working collaboratively to enhance the overall delivery framework.

## Highlights
- **Delivery Restructuring:** Collaborated with executive leadership to identify project management inefficiencies, resulting in a prioritized roadmap that improved customer adoption and capability delivery.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Implemented a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that enhanced project execution predictability through improved scope definition and Agile delivery frameworks.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to focus on customer feedback and value delivery, rather than just status updates.

## Technical Details
- Utilized Agile methodologies to establish iterative release cycles, ensuring that KPIs were tied to user impact and ROI.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping to enhance budget management and reduce variance.
- Developed a scalable Risk Management framework that was embedded in product lifecycle reviews, enabling proactive risk mitigation.

## Key Accomplishments
- Achieved a 90% YoY improvement in budget variance, reducing it to within 3% through effective financial oversight.
- Successfully launched the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, establishing a repeatable product release process.
- Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months, significantly improving responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams around value streams instead of projects.

Scott's leadership and strategic planning capabilities not only revitalized the PMO but also positioned Binary Defense for sustained growth and improved customer satisfaction in a highly competitive cybersecurity landscape.
