# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with previous leadership struggling to maintain risk, budget, and schedule control. My primary responsibility was to strengthen product execution through PMO revitalization, ensuring that delivery aligned with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members, including project managers, product owners, and technical leads, all focused on enhancing the delivery of cybersecurity solutions.

## Highlights
- **Delivery Restructuring:** Collaborated with executive leadership to assess and address project management inefficiencies, resulting in a prioritized roadmap that improved customer adoption and capability delivery.
- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Developed a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that enhanced project execution predictability through improved scope definition and Agile delivery frameworks.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to focus on customer feedback and value delivery, leading to a more engaged stakeholder environment.

## Technical Details
- Implemented Agile methodologies, including SCRUM and PMR cycles, to improve project execution and responsiveness to market needs.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping to enhance budget management and reduce variance.
- Developed a scalable Risk Management framework that embedded cyber risk assessments into the product lifecycle, enabling proactive risk mitigation.

## Key Accomplishments
- Achieved a 90% YoY improvement in budget variance, reducing it to within 3% through effective financial oversight.
- Successfully launched and scaled the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, establishing a repeatable product release process.
- Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months, enhancing the organization’s ability to respond to market demands and customer needs.

This role not only allowed me to leverage my extensive experience in program management and cybersecurity but also positioned Binary Defense for sustained growth and improved operational efficiency in a highly competitive market.
