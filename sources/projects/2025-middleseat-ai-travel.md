# Context
As a dynamic PMO and business leader with 20+ years of experience delivering enterprise IT, cyber, cloud transformation, and infrastructure projects, I developed middleseat.app as a personal growth project in artificial intelligence to explore consumer AI applications.

## Highlights
- Architected a hybrid decision engine combining deterministic flight cost analysis with generative AI scoring
- Designed a scalable metadata enrichment layer using JSONB in PostgreSQL/Supabase
- Positioned the platform for future growth by reducing token usage through smart prompt compression
- Built end-to-end consumer travel app with extensive AI-powered features for intelligent destination matching

## Technical Details
- **Hybrid Decision Engine**: Combines deterministic flight cost analysis with generative AI scoring to balance economy vs. quality experiences
- **Scalable Metadata Layer**: JSONB in PostgreSQL/Supabase allows AI model to access and reason over structured tags
- **AI Optimization**: Smart prompt compression and AI filtering logic for drastically improved performance and token/speed efficiency
- **User Preference Matching**: Intelligent destination matching based on user preferences, flight data, and activity relevance
