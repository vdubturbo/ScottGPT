- System health metrics (API response times, error rates)
- Webhook processing statistics
- Revenue and subscription metrics

### Automated Alerts
- High error rate alerts (>5%)
- Low success rate alerts (<95%)
- High churn rate alerts (>10%)
- Manual review backlog alerts
- System performance degradation alerts

## Error Handling

### Recovery Strategies
