# Context
In my role as Senior Director of the Delivery Support Office (DSO) at Binary Defense, I was recruited to restore momentum across a $30M cybersecurity solution portfolio. The organization faced challenges with prior leadership struggling to manage risk, budget, and schedule control. My primary responsibility was to strengthen product execution through PMO revitalization, ensuring that delivery was aligned with strategic business outcomes. The DSO team consisted of cross-functional members focused on enhancing project management capabilities and improving customer adoption.

## Highlights

- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Developed a 30/60/90-day transformation plan that enhanced project execution predictability through improved scope definition and Agile delivery frameworks.
- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal communications to focus on customer feedback and value delivery, enhancing stakeholder engagement.

## Technical Details
- Implemented Agile delivery frameworks for iterative releases, establishing KPIs tied to user impact and ROI.
- Integrated finance controls with product roadmapping, ensuring budget variance was reduced to within 3%.
- Established PMR cycles and risk/change governance aligned to product milestones, enhancing overall project predictability.

## Key Accomplishments
- Achieved a 90% YoY improvement in budget variance management, demonstrating effective financial oversight.
- Authored and operationalized a scalable Risk Management framework that enabled earlier detection and mitigation of cyber risks.
- Successfully launched and scaled the organization’s first Agile pilot product, which was delivered on time and 37% under budget, proving the effectiveness of the Agile model.
- Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months, improving responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams around value streams instead of projects.

This role not only allowed me to leverage my extensive experience in program management and cybersecurity but also positioned Binary Defense for future growth through improved operational efficiencies and customer-centric strategies.
