**Binary Defense - Senior Director, Delivery Support Office (DSO) &
Maturity Consultant** (2023-CURRENT)

<u>Why I was hired:</u> Recruited to restore momentum across a \$30M
cybersecurity solution portfolio by strengthening product execution
through PMO revitalization, improving time-to-value, and aligning
delivery with strategic business outcomes after prior leadership
struggled with risk, budget, and schedule control.

<u>Product & Strategy Impact:</u>

- **Delivery Restructuring:** Partnered with executive leadership to
  assess project management and development and process inefficiencies,
  producing a prioritized roadmap for scaling capability delivery and
  improving customer adoption.

- **Value-Driven Process Redesign:** Established a 30/60/90-day
  transformation plan focused on improving project execution and
  predictability through:

  - Enhanced scope definition and requirements traceability tied to
    customer use cases.

  - Agile delivery frameworks for iterative releases, with KPIs tied to
    user impact and ROI.

  - PMR cycles and risk/change governance aligned to product milestones,
    not just schedules.

- **Customer-Centric Operating Rhythm:** Re-engineered internal
  communications and stakeholder engagement to focus on customer
  feedback, product telemetry, and value delivery rather than status
  alone.

<u>Outcomes:</u>

- **Improved Product Cost Management:** Reduced budget variance to
  within 3%, a 90% YoY improvement, by integrating finance controls with
  product roadmapping and delivery cadence.

- **Cyber Risk Culture:** Authored and operationalized a scalable Risk
  Management framework embedded in product lifecycle reviews—enabling
  earlier detection and mitigation of cyber risks in the portfolio.

- **Agile Transformation:** Launched and scaled the organization’s first
  Agile pilot product, delivered on time and 37% under budget—proving
  the model and establishing a repeatable product release process.

- **Accelerated Delivery:** Cut product planning cycle time by 3 months
  and improved responsiveness to market needs by restructuring teams
  around value streams instead of projects.

**McKesson Corporation – Sr. Director, OT Security Solutions & Delivery
(Global PMO Lead)** (2018-2020)

<u>Why I was hired:</u> Brought in to establish and scale a global PMO
capability to enable a \$700M cybersecurity transformation program
across 121 industrial facilities in North America and Europe—bridging a
critical execution gap for the organization’s first enterprise-wide OT
security initiative.

<u>Product & Operational Impact:</u>

- **Global Product Enablement:** Collaborated with stakeholders across
  security, operations, and engineering to define regional requirements
  and constraints—turning security capabilities into repeatable,
  deployable solutions for diverse physical environments.

- **Delivery Model Optimization:** Transitioned the initiative from SAFe
  Agile to SCRUM, improving planning efficiency by 75% and aligning
  delivery cycles with operational readiness at the plant level.

- **Execution Infrastructure:** Built a scalable PMO framework that
  integrated financial oversight, schedule governance, risk and change
  management, and executive reporting—serving as the operating system
  for global OT security capability deployment.

- **Cross-Functional Synergy:** Acted as the connective tissue between
  architecture, product, and implementation teams to ensure timely
  rollout of cybersecurity controls and tools tailored to each site’s
  threat profile and operational maturity.

- **Quality at Scale:** Launched McKesson’s first Lean Six Sigma-aligned
  QA process for OT initiatives, improving quality assurance across
  product deployments and ensuring consistent adoption across
  geographies.
